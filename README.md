Deep Learning for classification using PyTorch - [report](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16841518/301407844.pdf):
1. Improving BaseNet on CIFAR100: We improve the base model using data normalization, data augmentation, normalization layers and adding more layers. 
2. Transfer Learning: Load the pre-trained ResNet18 model and modify the fully-connected layers.
